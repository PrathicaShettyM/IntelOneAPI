# Object Oriented Programming using Java
This repository contains OOPs concepts in Java programming language.

### Pillars of OOPs:
1. `Datahiding`: achieved using private access modifier
2. `Abstraction`: achieved using abstract class and interface
3. `Encapsulation`: Encapsulation = Datahiding + Abstraction
4. `Polymorphism`: comes through Inheritence

#### Inheritence: 
- The process of acquiring the properties and behaviours of one class to another class is called "Inheritence".
- In Java, inheritence can be achieved in 2 forms
1. IS   - A(using the `extends` keyword)
2. HAS  - A(Declaring one ref variable inside another class)

- The class which share properties / behaviours to another  class is referred as `Base Class/ Parent Class`.
- The class which uses properties / behaviour of another class is referred as `Derieved Class/ Child Class`.
